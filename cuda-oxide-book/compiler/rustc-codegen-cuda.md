# The Code Generator: rustc-codegen-cuda

Every Rust program eventually reaches the codegen backend -- the part of the
compiler that turns optimized MIR into machine code. Normally, that backend is
LLVM. cuda-oxide swaps in its own backend, `rustc-codegen-cuda`, which
intercepts this process to extract device code and route it through the
cuda-oxide pipeline before handing everything else back to LLVM as if nothing
happened.

This page explains how that backend loads, what it does when rustc calls it,
and how it finds every function that belongs on the GPU.

---

## How rustc Loads a Custom Backend

rustc has a flag most people never see:

```bash
rustc -Z codegen-backend=path/to/libfoo.so
```

When you pass this flag, rustc does the following:

1. Calls `dlopen` on the shared library.
2. Calls `dlsym("__rustc_codegen_backend")` to find the entry point.
3. Expects that function to return a `Box<dyn CodegenBackend>`.

That's it. No plugin registry, no config files, no handshake protocol. One
symbol, one trait object, and you own the codegen pipeline.

cuda-oxide provides this entry point:

```rust
#[unsafe(no_mangle)]
pub fn __rustc_codegen_backend() -> Box<dyn CodegenBackend> {
    let config = CudaCodegenConfig::from_env();
    let llvm_backend = rustc_codegen_llvm::LlvmCodegenBackend::new();
    Box::new(CudaCodegenBackend { config, llvm_backend })
}
```

Two things happen here. First, `CudaCodegenConfig::from_env()` reads
environment variables (`CUDA_OXIDE_VERBOSE`, `CUDA_OXIDE_DUMP_MIR`, and
friends -- see {ref}`Environment Variables
<rustc-codegen-environment-variables>` below) to
configure the backend's behavior. Second, it creates the standard LLVM backend
and stores it inside the `CudaCodegenBackend`. This is the wrapping pattern
that makes the whole architecture work: cuda-oxide does not *replace* the LLVM
backend, it *wraps* it.

```{note}
`cargo oxide build` sets the `-Z codegen-backend` flag for you. You never need
to type the `dlopen` incantation yourself unless you enjoy that sort of thing.
```

---

## The Intercept: codegen_crate()

The `CodegenBackend` trait has several methods, but the one that matters is
`codegen_crate(tcx)`. This is where rustc hands over the entire typed,
borrow-checked, monomorphized crate and says "make this into machine code."

When rustc calls `CudaCodegenBackend::codegen_crate(tcx)`, here is what
happens:

### Step 1: Collect Monomorphized Items

```rust
let (items, cgus) = tcx.collect_and_partition_mono_items(());
```

This gives us every monomorphized function in the crate, grouped into
**codegen units** (CGUs). A CGU is rustc's unit of parallel code generation --
think of it as a bucket of functions that will become one object file.

### Step 2: Scan for Device Entry Points

The backend iterates over every function in every CGU and checks for the magic
name prefixes:

- `cuda_oxide_kernel_<hash>_` -- set by `#[kernel]`
- `cuda_oxide_device_<hash>_` -- set by `#[device]`

These prefixes are how the proc macros communicate with the backend. There is
no special attribute metadata, no side channel -- just a name that stands out
in a crowd. The exact prefix strings (and the helpers that match and strip
them) live in the workspace-internal `reserved-oxide-symbols` crate; both the
macro side and the collector side import from there so the contract stays in
one place. The 8-hex-char `<hash>` makes accidental collisions effectively
impossible: nobody writes `cuda_oxide_kernel_246e25db_foo` by accident.

### Step 3: If Device Code Found, Build and Compile

If any kernel or device function is found, two things happen in sequence:

**a) Collect the device call graph.**
`collector::collect_device_functions()` performs a breadth-first walk from
every kernel entry point, discovering all functions that transitively get
called from device code. More on this in {ref}`Device Function Collection
<rustc-codegen-device-function-collection>`.

**b) Generate device code.**
`device_codegen::generate_device_code()` bridges the collected functions to
stable MIR and runs the full cuda-oxide pipeline (`dialect-mir` -> `mem2reg`
-> `dialect-llvm` -> `.ll` -> PTX).

### Step 4: Always Compile Host Code

Regardless of whether device code was found:

```rust
self.llvm_backend.codegen_crate(tcx)
```

The wrapped LLVM backend compiles all the host code -- `main()`, your CLI
parser, your async runtime, everything. The device pipeline is a side quest;
the host pipeline always runs.

### The Other Trait Methods

The `CodegenBackend` trait also requires `join_codegen()` and `link()`. These
handle waiting for parallel codegen threads and invoking the linker,
respectively. In cuda-oxide, both are pure delegation:

```rust
fn join_codegen(&self, ongoing: Box<dyn Any>, sess: &Session) -> ... {
    self.llvm_backend.join_codegen(ongoing, sess)
}

fn link(&self, sess: &Session, codegen: ..., outputs: &OutputFilenames) -> ... {
    self.llvm_backend.link(sess, codegen, outputs)
}
```

No interception, no modification. The LLVM backend handles linking exactly as
it normally would.

```{note}
For most crates in the dependency tree -- `core`, `cuda-core`, random
utility crates -- no kernels are found and the backend just delegates to LLVM.
The device pipeline only activates for the crate that actually contains a
`#[kernel]` function. For a typical project, that means one crate out of
dozens triggers device compilation.
```

(rustc-codegen-device-function-collection)=

## Device Function Collection

Finding kernel entry points is the easy part. The hard part is figuring out
*everything else* those kernels call. A kernel might call a helper, which calls
a `cuda-device` intrinsic, which calls a `core` math function -- and all of
those need to end up in the PTX.

The `collector` module handles this with a breadth-first traversal of the MIR
call graph.

### The Worklist Algorithm

```text
worklist = [all kernel entry points]
visited  = {}
collected = []

while worklist is not empty:
    fn = worklist.pop()
    if fn in visited: continue
    visited.add(fn)

    mir = tcx.instance_mir(fn)
    collected.push(fn)

    for basic_block in mir:
        for terminator in [Call, Drop]:
            callee = resolve_callee(terminator)
            if should_collect(callee):
                worklist.push(callee)
```

For each function, the collector retrieves its MIR via `tcx.instance_mir()`,
then scans every basic block's terminator. `Call` and `Drop` terminators
reference callees, which get added to the worklist if they pass the crate
filtering rules.

The output is a `Vec<CollectedFunction>`, where each entry carries:

- The monomorphized `Instance` (the fully resolved, generic-free function).
- An `is_kernel` flag (for marking GPU entry points in the PTX metadata).
- The `export_name` (the symbol name visible in the final PTX).

### Export Names and FQDN Alignment

The collector must produce export names that match what the MIR translator
generates for call targets. Both sides use **fully qualified domain names
(FQDNs)** -- for example, `helper_fn::cuda_oxide_device_<hash>_vecadd_device` rather
than bare `vecadd_device`.

The `rustc_public` API's `CrateDef::name()` returns FQDNs including the crate
name. On the collector side, `def_path_str()` omits the crate name for local
items, so a small helper (`fqdn()`) prepends it for local definitions to
produce the same string.

During lowering, `::` is converted to `__` on both the definition and call
sides, producing valid LLVM/PTX identifiers (e.g., `helper_fn__vecadd_device`).

For generic or complex names (angle brackets, closures), the mangled symbol
name is used instead -- this is unique and already a valid identifier.

Kernel entry points follow a separate path: `compute_kernel_export_name`
takes the `#[kernel]` macro's base name and, for generic and closure-
generic instantiations, appends `_TID_<hex32>` where `<hex32>` is
rustc's 128-bit type-id hash of the tuple of generic arguments. The
host launcher computes the same hash through the `core::intrinsics::type_id`
intrinsic (wrapped by `cuda_host::type_id_u128`), so both sides agree
byte-for-byte. Non-generic kernels keep their bare base name.

```{note}
This FQDN alignment strategy will be replaced by pliron's `Legaliser` when
the framework is upgraded. The `Legaliser` provides systematic name
sanitization with collision detection, making manual `::` to `__` replacement
unnecessary.
```

### Crate Filtering Rules

Not every function in the dependency tree belongs on a GPU. The collector
enforces rules about which crates are allowed in device code:

| Crate                 | Status                     | Notes                                        |
| :-------------------- | :------------------------- | :------------------------------------------- |
| Local crate           | Allowed                    | Your kernel code                             |
| `cuda_device`         | Allowed                    | GPU intrinsics (stubs filtered -- see below) |
| `core`                | Allowed                    | `no_std` standard library                    |
| Other `no_std` crates | Allowed                    | Any crate in the dependency tree             |
| `std`                 | **Forbidden**              | Compile-time error                           |
| `alloc`               | Allowed (if GPU allocator) | Experimental                                 |

The rule is simple: if a crate could conceivably run on a GPU (no OS
dependencies, no file I/O, no networking), it is allowed. If it drags in
`std`, it is not.

### Error Messages

When someone accidentally tries to use `std` in device code -- perhaps a
stray `println!` left over from debugging -- the collector produces a clear
error instead of letting the build fail with an inscrutable PTX assembler
message three stages later:

```text
CUDA-OXIDE: FORBIDDEN CRATE IN DEVICE CODE
Device code calls: std::io::_print
From crate: 'std'
Only these crates are allowed in device code:
  - Local crate (your kernel code)
  - cuda_device (GPU intrinsics)
  - core (no_std standard library)
```

This is one of the advantages of catching the problem at the call graph level
rather than hoping LLVM will produce a useful diagnostic. (It won't.)

### Intrinsic Stub Filtering

`cuda_device` contains functions like `threadIdx_x()` whose bodies are just
`unreachable!()`. These are stubs -- placeholders that exist so rustc can
type-check device code, but they are never meant to be compiled as real
functions. They get replaced by `dialect-nvvm` operations later in the
pipeline (for instance, `threadIdx_x()` becomes `nvvm.read_ptx_sreg_tid_x`).

The collector recognizes these stubs -- they come from `cuda_device` and have no
meaningful MIR beyond a single `unreachable` terminator -- and skips them. If
you are wondering "but if the body is `unreachable!()`, won't that panic at
runtime?": no, because `mir-importer` replaces calls to these functions with
the corresponding GPU hardware instructions before any code generation
happens. The stub body never executes.

---

## Cross-Crate Device Compilation

Here is a question that sounds simple until you think about it: when you call
`cuda_device::thread::index_1d()` from a kernel, how does the compiler get that
function's MIR? Your crate does not have its source code. `cuda_device` was
compiled hours ago, possibly by a different machine.

The answer lies in how rustc stores metadata.

### The .rlib Flow

When rustc compiles `cuda_device`, there are no `#[kernel]` functions in that
crate. The cuda-oxide backend finds nothing to intercept and delegates
entirely to LLVM. The output is a standard `.rlib` archive containing:

- **Compiled machine code** -- the host-side object file.
- **`.rmeta` metadata blob** -- type information, trait impls, and crucially,
  **serialized optimized MIR** for certain functions.

Later, when you compile your `vecadd` crate, the collector finds a kernel
entry point and starts the BFS walk. It encounters a call to
`cuda_device::thread::index_1d()`. At this point, `tcx.instance_mir()` reaches
into `cuda_device`'s `.rmeta` blob and retrieves the function's MIR -- fully
optimized, monomorphized, ready to translate.

```{figure} images/cross-crate-rlib.svg
:align: center
:width: 100%

Cross-crate device compilation. Phase 1 compiles cuda_device into an .rlib with
serialized MIR in its .rmeta blob. Phase 2 compiles vecadd -- the collector
finds a kernel, BFS walks into cuda_device, reads the MIR from .rmeta, and
compiles everything to PTX.
```

Device code from dependency crates is compiled to PTX **lazily** -- only when
a kernel in your crate transitively references it. If you never call a
function, it never ends up in the PTX, even if it exists in the dependency.

### Which Functions Get Their MIR Encoded in .rmeta?

Not every function's MIR survives into the `.rmeta` blob. rustc has rules
about what gets serialized:

| Category                      | Why it's serialized                                           |
| :---------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Generic functions             | Must be monomorphized downstream -- the MIR is the "template" |
| `#[inline]` functions         | Explicitly requested for cross-crate inlining                 |
| `#[inline(always)]` functions | Same, but more insistent about it                             |
| Small leaf functions          | Heuristic: no calls, few statements -- cheap to inline        |

Most `cuda_device` functions fall into at least one of these categories. GPU
intrinsics are small. Helper functions are `#[inline]`. Generic functions over
element types are, well, generic. The result is that virtually all device-side
library code has its MIR available for cross-crate compilation.

```{note}
This is not a cuda-oxide feature -- it is standard rustc behavior, designed
to support cross-crate inlining and generic instantiation. cuda-oxide just
happens to benefit enormously from it, since the same mechanism that lets
rustc inline a `Vec::push` call across crates also lets us compile a
`cuda_device::thread::index_1d()` call to PTX.
```

## The Bridge to Stable MIR

After the collector finishes, we have a `Vec<CollectedFunction>` containing
every device function as an internal rustc `Instance`. But `mir-importer` does
not speak rustc internals -- it works with the stable MIR API provided by
`rustc_public`. We need a bridge.

The `device_codegen` module handles the translation:

```rust
rustc_internal::run(tcx, || {
    let stable_instances: Vec<_> = collected
        .iter()
        .map(|f| rustc_internal::stable(f.instance))
        .collect();
    mir_importer::run_pipeline(&stable_instances, &config)
})
```

Two things are happening here:

1. **`rustc_internal::run(tcx, || { ... })`** sets up the thread-local context
   that `rustc_public` requires. Inside this closure, stable MIR queries work.
   Outside it, they would panic -- the stable API needs access to the compiler
   session, and this function provides it.

2. **`rustc_internal::stable(f.instance)`** converts each internal
   `rustc_middle::ty::Instance` to its stable equivalent,
   `stable_mir::mir::mono::Instance`. This is a one-way conversion -- internal
   types can become stable types, but not the other way around.

Once the conversion is done, `mir_importer::run_pipeline()` takes over. It
reads the stable MIR for each instance, translates it into pliron's MIR
dialect, and runs the full lowering pipeline through to PTX. That process is
covered in [The MIR Importer](mir-importer.md).

(rustc-codegen-environment-variables)=

## Environment Variables

`CudaCodegenConfig::from_env()` reads the following environment variables to
control the backend's behavior. All are optional -- the defaults produce a
quiet, production-oriented build.

| Variable                    | Effect                                                                                 |
| :-------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `CUDA_OXIDE_VERBOSE`        | Print compilation progress (which kernels were found, pipeline stages, timing)         |
| `CUDA_OXIDE_DUMP_MIR`       | Dump the `dialect-mir` module to stderr after import (and after `mem2reg`)             |
| `CUDA_OXIDE_DUMP_LLVM`      | Dump the `dialect-llvm` module to stderr after lowering                                |
| `CUDA_OXIDE_PTX_DIR`        | Override the output directory for `.ptx` files (default: next to the host binary)      |
| `CUDA_OXIDE_TARGET`         | Override the GPU target architecture (e.g., `sm_90a` for Hopper)                       |
| `CUDA_OXIDE_SHOW_RUSTC_MIR` | Dump the raw rustc MIR before translation to pliron (useful for debugging import bugs) |

These are intentionally environment variables rather than command-line flags.
The codegen backend receives very limited information from rustc's argument
parser -- environment variables are the simplest way to pass configuration
without fighting the compiler driver's flag plumbing.

```{note}
`CUDA_OXIDE_VERBOSE=1 cargo oxide build` is your best friend when debugging
the compiler. It shows exactly which functions were collected, which crates
they came from, and how long each pipeline stage took.
```

---

## Putting It All Together

Here is the complete flow from `cargo oxide build` to a `.ptx` file, as seen
from the codegen backend:

```{figure} images/codegen-flow.svg
:align: center
:width: 100%

The complete codegen backend flow. When codegen_crate is called, CGUs are
scanned for kernel/device symbols. If found, the collector does a BFS walk, the
device codegen bridge converts to stable MIR, and mir_importer produces PTX. The
LLVM host backend always runs regardless.
```

The beauty of the wrapping pattern is that cuda-oxide is invisible to the rest
of the compilation pipeline. The linker sees normal object files. The build
system sees normal artifacts. The only evidence that anything unusual happened
is a `.ptx` file sitting next to the host binary, ready to be loaded by the
CUDA driver at runtime.

---

## Where to Go Next

With device functions collected and stable MIR in hand, the next stage is
translation -- covered in [The MIR Importer](mir-importer.md).
