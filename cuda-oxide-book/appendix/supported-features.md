# Supported Features

This appendix presents the cuda-oxide feature matrix: every compiler capability,
runtime API, and hardware feature along with its current support status. The
data is drawn from the compiler/runtime sources and the test suite.

**Legend:** **Full** = tested and working, **Partial** = ships and works but
has a known gap (called out in the row description), **Planned** = on the
roadmap, **N/A** = not applicable or no identified need.

## Compiler: Memory Model

| Feature | Status | Description |
|:--------|:-------|:------------|
| HMM / Unified Memory Management | **Full** | GPU directly reads/writes host memory without `cudaMemcpy`. Reference captures in closures leverage HMM for host pointer access. Requires Turing+ GPU, Linux 6.1.24+, CUDA 12.2+. |
| Unified Struct ABI (no `#[repr(C)]`) | **Full** | Device struct layout matches host exactly. The compiler queries rustc's actual layout and reproduces it with explicit padding in LLVM IR. Works with `#[repr(Rust)]` default. |
| Dynamic Layout Matching | **Full** | Compiler queries rustc's `fields_by_offset_order()` and byte offsets, builds LLVM structs with correct field order and explicit padding bytes. Independent of LLVM's datalayout. |

## Compiler: Type System

| Feature | Status | Description |
|:--------|:-------|:------------|
| Generics and Monomorphization | **Full** | Generic kernels and device functions with trait bounds. Monomorphized instances collected from rustc MIR. Const generics supported. |
| Enums (`Option<T>`, `Result<T,E>`, custom) | **Full** | Full enum support including discriminant extraction and payload access. Pattern matching on enums works. |
| Struct Construction and Field Access | **Full** | Struct literals, field access, pass-by-value and return values. User-defined structs supported without annotations. |
| Array Types (`[T; N]`) | **Full** | Static array construction, constant-index and runtime-index access. Mutable arrays auto-promoted to memory-backed. |
| `CuSimd<T, N>` SIMD Type | **Full** | Generic SIMD register type with named accessors (`x`/`y`/`z`/`w`), runtime and compile-time indexing, `to_array` conversion. |
| ABI Scalarization | **Full** | Slices are scalarized at kernel boundaries (`&[T]` -> `(ptr, len)`, reconstructed inside the function). Structs and closures pass by value as one byval `.param`; field flattening still applies on internal device-to-device calls. |

## Compiler: Closures

| Feature | Status | Description |
|:--------|:-------|:------------|
| Move Closures (`FnOnce`) | **Full** | Closures that capture by value. The whole closure struct is pushed as one byval kernel argument. `move \|x\| x * factor` pattern. |
| Reference Closures (`Fn`/`FnMut`) | **Full** | Non-move closures that capture by reference. The closure struct (containing host pointers) still travels as one byval argument; the GPU reads through those pointers via HMM. |
| Host-to-Device Closures | **Full** | Closures defined on host passed to generic kernels. Polynomial evaluation with captured coefficients tested. |
| Device-Internal Closures | **Full** | Closures created and used entirely on device, including closures passed to device functions. |

## Compiler: Control Flow

| Feature | Status | Description |
|:--------|:-------|:------------|
| Match Expressions (integer switch) | **Full** | Multi-way match on integers. Generates chain of conditional branches. |
| Match on Enums | **Full** | Pattern matching on `Option<T>` and custom enums. Discriminant extraction + payload access. |
| For Loops (range, iterator, enumerate) | **Full** | Full iterator desugaring: range-based, `slice.iter()`, `enumerate()`, nested loops, `break`, `continue`. |
| While Loops / If-Else | **Full** | Baseline control flow fully supported. |
| Break and Continue | **Full** | `break` and `continue` in for/while loops, including early exit. |

## Compiler: Arithmetic and Casting

| Feature | Status | Description |
|:--------|:-------|:------------|
| 64-bit Arithmetic | **Full** | Full 64-bit integer arithmetic including shifts, bitwise ops, and descriptor field packing. |
| Type Casting (all kinds) | **Full** | IntToInt, IntToFloat, FloatToInt, FloatToFloat, Transmute (bitcast), PtrToPtr, PtrToInt, IntToPtr, pointer coercions. |

## Compiler: Interop

| Feature | Status | Description |
|:--------|:-------|:------------|
| Bi-directional LTOIR Support | **Full** | Rust kernels call CUDA C++ device functions **and** C++ calls Rust device functions. Via NVVM IR → libNVVM → LTOIR → nvJitLink. |
| Device FFI (`extern "C"`) | **Full** | `#[device] extern "C" { fn ... }` declarations for external LTOIR functions. CUB/CCCL integration demonstrated. |
| MathDx FFI (cuFFTDx / cuBLASDx) | **Full** | cuFFTDx (8/16/32-point thread-level FFT), cuBLASDx (32x32x32 block-level GEMM) via LTOIR. |
| Cross-Crate Kernels | **Full** | Kernels and device functions defined in library crates with monomorphization at the binary crate use site. |

## Compiler: Functions

| Feature | Status | Description |
|:--------|:-------|:------------|
| `#[kernel]` Attribute | **Full** | Marks functions as GPU kernel entry points (`ptx_kernel` calling convention). Multiple kernels per file. |
| `#[device]` Helper Functions | **Full** | Device-side helper functions callable from kernels. Inlined aggressively by `llc`. |
| Standalone `#[device]` Functions | **Full** | Device functions compiled without any kernel present. Clean export names for C++ consumption. |
| Multi-Kernel Modules | **Full** | Multiple `#[kernel]` functions in a single source file compile to a single PTX module. |

## Compiler: Compilation Pipeline

| Feature | Status | Description |
|:--------|:-------|:------------|
| Unified Single-Source Compilation | **Full** | Host and device code in the same file. Custom rustc codegen backend intercepts codegen. No `#[cfg]` needed. |
| PTX Output | **Full** | Default output: Rust MIR → `dialect-mir` → `mem2reg` → `dialect-llvm` → LLVM IR → `llc` → PTX. Targets sm_80 through sm_100a. |
| NVVM IR Output | **Full** | Alternative output for libNVVM consumption with NVVM metadata. |
| LTOIR Output | **Full** | Device-side LTO for linking with CUDA C++. Via `--dlto` flag or `CUDA_OXIDE_EMIT_LTOIR`. |
| Float Math Intrinsics (libdevice) | **Full** | Rust `f32`/`f64` math methods (`sin`, `cos`, `exp`, `pow`, `sqrt`, ...) lower to CUDA libdevice (`__nv_*`). cuda-oxide auto-detects libdevice usage and emits NVVM IR; `cuda_host::load_kernel_module` (sync) and `cuda_host::load_kernel_module_async` (async) build the cubin via libNVVM + nvJitLink at runtime. |
| Pipeline Inspection | **Full** | `cargo oxide pipeline <example>` shows IR at each compilation stage. |
| cuda-gdb Debug Support | **Full** | Build with debug info and launch `cuda-gdb`. `breakpoint()` intrinsic for programmatic breakpoints. |

## Runtime Library: Safety

| Feature | Status | Description |
|:--------|:-------|:------------|
| `DisjointSlice<T, IndexSpace>` | **Full** | Bounds-checked parallel write output slice. `get_mut` and `get_mut_indexed` return `Option<&mut T>`. The `IndexSpace` type parameter rejects mismatched 2D strides at compile time. |
| `ThreadIndex<'kernel, IndexSpace>` | **Full** | Opaque witness only constructable by trusted index functions. `!Send + !Sync + !Copy + !Clone`, `'kernel`-scoped — non-transferable across threads, can't outlive the kernel body. |
| `ManagedBarrier` Typestate | **Full** | Compile-time barrier lifecycle: `Uninit → Ready → Invalidated`. Invalid transitions are compile errors. |

## Runtime Library: Atomics

| Feature | Status | Description |

## Not Yet Implemented

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|:--------|:-------|:------|
| Inline Assembly (`asm!` macro) | **Planned** | Workaround: use built-in intrinsics or add new intrinsics to `cuda-device`. |
| FP8 / MX Data Types | **Planned** | Roadmap item for Blackwell. No architectural limitation. |
| Dynamic Dispatch (`dyn Trait`) | **N/A** | Use generics with static dispatch. Haven't found a real need for this. |
| Heap Allocation (`Box`, `Vec`) | **N/A** | CUDA has a device-side heap (`malloc`/`free` in kernels), and the compiler allows the `alloc` crate through -- but no device-side `#[global_allocator]` is wired up today. Even if it were, device `malloc` is extremely slow (serialized, fragmented, uncoalesced). Use slices and `SharedArray`. |
| `String` / `format_args!` | **N/A** | Use `gpu_printf!` for formatted output. |
| Panic / Unwinding | **N/A** | Panic paths exist in MIR but the compiler strips `core::panicking::*` and all unwind edges. The GPU hardware *can* support unwinding (absolute branches + per-thread call stack tracking post-Volta), but the CUDA toolchain (nvcc/ptxas) doesn't expose it today -- no landing pads survive to PTX. If a panic path is reached at runtime the GPU traps (same as `panic=abort`). NVIDIA has an active project to add C++ exception support to CUDA for automotive safety; the current cuda-oxide design is forward-compatible with that work. Use `gpu_assert!()` + `trap()` for explicit runtime checks today. |
| Standard Library (`std`/`alloc`) | **N/A** | `std` is forbidden. `alloc` is allowed by the collector but has no backing allocator. Only `core` is fully functional. `Option`, `Result`, iterators all work. |
| Texture Memory | **N/A** | Lower priority given TMA availability on Hopper+. |
