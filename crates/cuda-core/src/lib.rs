//! Safe RAII wrappers around the CUDA driver API.
//!
//! This crate provides Rust-idiomatic, RAII-managed wrappers over the low-level CUDA
//! driver API (`cuInit`, `cuCtx*`, `cuStream*`, `cuEvent*`, `cuModule*`, `cuMem*`).
//! All GPU resources are released automatically on [`Drop`], and error codes are
//! propagated as [`DriverError`] values.
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! - [`CudaContext`] -- retains the device primary context and tracks per-context
//!   state (stream count, error accumulation).
//! - [`CudaStream`] -- non-blocking stream with fork/join parallelism and host
//!   callback support for bridging to async Rust.
//! - [`CudaEvent`] -- lightweight synchronization primitive for inter-stream
//!   ordering and elapsed-time measurement.
//! - [`CudaModule`] / [`CudaFunction`] -- PTX/cubin loading and kernel handle
//!   extraction.
//! - [`LaunchConfig`] -- grid/block dimension helper.
//! - [`memory`] -- free functions for device allocation, transfer, and memset
//!   (both stream-ordered async and synchronous variants).
//!
//! # Context binding
//!
//! Most driver calls require a CUDA context bound to the calling thread. Methods
//! on the wrapper types call [`CudaContext::bind_to_thread`] internally so the
//! caller does not need to manage `cuCtxSetCurrent` manually.
//!
//! # Re-exports
//!
//! Raw bindings are available as [`sys`] for any driver entry point not yet
//! wrapped.
