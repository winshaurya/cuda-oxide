//! Owned and borrowed wrappers around CUDA device pointers.
//!
//! [`DevicePointer`] is a thin, `Copy` handle to device memory suitable for
//! passing as a kernel argument. [`DeviceBox`] owns device memory and frees it
//! asynchronously through a dedicated deallocator stream on drop.
//!
//! # Async deallocation
//!
//! [`DeviceBox`] enqueues `cuMemFreeAsync` on a per-device deallocator stream
//! rather than blocking with `cuMemFree`. Callers **must** synchronize all
//! streams that reference the allocation before dropping the box.
