//! Negative test: `wgmma_mma_*` is not yet implemented.
//!
//! `cuda_device::wgmma::wgmma_mma_m64n64k16_f32_bf16` and friends call into
//! a placeholder lowering whose full implementation requires register
//! allocation for 16+ output registers. Until that lands, the codegen
//! backend is expected to reject these calls at build time with a clear
//! diagnostic — not silently emit a comment and produce PTX that
//! multiplies-accumulates to zero.
//!
//! Usage:
//!   cargo oxide run error_wgmma_mma_unimplemented
//!
//! Expected: build FAILS with
//!   "wgmma.mma_async lowering is not yet implemented; ..."
