//! Negative test: `core::ptr::copy_nonoverlapping` is not yet supported.
//!
//! `copy_nonoverlapping` lowers to a MIR `StatementKind::Intrinsic(
//! NonDivergingIntrinsic::CopyNonOverlapping(_))`. The mir-importer's
//! statement translator must reject this with a clear diagnostic until the
//! lowering is implemented — the previous catch-all silently dropped the
//! statement, producing PTX where the memcpy was completely absent.
//!
//! Usage:
//!   cargo oxide run error_copy_nonoverlapping_unhandled
//!
//! Expected: build FAILS with
//!   "core::ptr::copy_nonoverlapping is not yet supported on the device; ..."
